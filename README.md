This is a problem statement I took from geeksforgeeks for my college
<br />
I solved this using recursion and memory function
<br /> <br />

<b>OUTPUT (recursion)</b> <br />
swimandgowaterlikeicecreamimangoplaypark <br />
Word can be broken  <br />
Execution time is 0.000839  <br />

<b>OUTPUT (memory function)</b>  <br />
swimandgowaterlikeicecreamimangoplaypark <br />
Word can be broken  <br />
Execution time is 0.001602<br />
<br />

<b>OUTPUT 2(recursion) </b><br />
swimandgowaterlikeicecreamimangoplayparksdkf <br />
Word cannot be broken  <br />
Execution time is 0.004317  <br />


<b>OUTPUT 2(memory function)</b>  <br />
swimandgowaterlikeicecreamimangoplayparksdkf <br />
Word cannot be broken  <br />
Execution time is 0.002004<br />
<br />



So as we can see the execution time is reduced in memory function
