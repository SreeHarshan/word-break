This is a problem statement I took from geeksforgeeks for my college
<br />
I solved this using recursion and memory function
<br /> <br />

OUTPUT (recursion) <br />
ilikeicecream <br />
Word can be broken  <br />
Execution time is 0.000070  <br />

OUTPUT (memory function)  <br />
ilikeicecream <br />
Word can be broken  <br />
Execution time is 0.000044  <br />
<br />
So as we can see the execution time is reduced in memory function
