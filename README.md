This is a problem statement I took from geeksforgeeks for my college
<br />
I solved this using recursion and memory function
<br /> <br />

OUTPUT (recursion) <br />
swimandgowaterlikeicecreamimangoplaypark <br />
Word can be broken  <br />
Execution time is 0.000839  <br />

OUTPUT (memory function)  <br />
swimandgowaterlikeicecreamimangoplaypark <br />
Word can be broken  <br />
Execution time is 0.001602<br />
<br />

OUTPUT 2(recursion) <br />
swimandgowaterlikeicecreamimangoplayparksdkf <br />
Word can be broken  <br />
Execution time is 0.004317  <br />


OUTPUT 2(memory function)  <br />
swimandgowaterlikeicecreamimangoplayparksdkf <br />
Word can be broken  <br />
Execution time is 0.002004<br />
<br />



So as we can see the execution time is reduced in memory function
